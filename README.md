## Overview

**FreshFloor Tiles™** are **snap-lock modular flooring panels** that **purify indoor air, self-clean, and reduce maintenance needs** while delivering a **stylish, durable surface** for residential and commercial spaces.  

Each tile uses a **mycelium-carbon composite core** to actively absorb **VOCs, CO₂, and odors**, while the **hydrophobic, anti-microbial surface coating** minimizes dirt buildup and cleaning frequency by up to 80%.

---

## Core Features

- **Air-Purifying Core** – Mycelium-carbon matrix captures **pollutants, allergens, and CO₂**.  
- **Self-Cleaning Top Layer** – Hydrophobic and anti-microbial finish keeps floors cleaner longer.  
- **Snap-Lock Installation** – Easy DIY setup with **no glue or nails**.  
- **Durable & Sustainable** – Made from **renewable, compostable materials** with long lifespan.  
- **Optional Aromatics** – Slow-release plant-based scent modules for wellness spaces.

---

## How It Works

1. **Mycelium-Carbon Core** – Filters indoor air by absorbing VOCs and particulates.  
2. **Hydrophobic Coating** – Repels dirt, liquids, and microbes, reducing cleaning needs.  
3. **Snap-Lock Frame** – Panels connect securely, allowing easy customization or replacement.  
4. **Passive Scent Modules (Optional)** – Infused essential oils for a natural, subtle aroma.
